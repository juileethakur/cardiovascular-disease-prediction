# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This was a project developed for Applied Machine Learning class in Fall 2022.

• We performed classification using five algorithms: 
> Logistic regression
> SVM
> KNN
> Naïve Bayes Algorithm
> Decision Tree Classifier.

• We then compared each of their classification reports and the accuracy of all the algorithms.
• Based on the classification reports, we predicted the probability of a person getting a heart attack.
